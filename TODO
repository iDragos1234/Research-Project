# Coding TODOs

## Dicom Preprocessor
+ Migrate `CropOrPad` transform from `model.py` to `dicom_transform.py`;
    + Add new command-line args for setting the desired image size after applying `CropOrPad`;
    * Note: I only implemented `Pad` since `Crop` likely to give unwanted results;
+ Improve transforms;

## Data splitter
+ Train/valid/test data splitter;
+ Output split to .csv file;

## DicomDataset
+ Improve current dataset class;
+ Improve dataset builder class;

## Training loop
+ Improve current training loop;
+ Save metrics, losses, images and masks;
    + Tensorboard still does not show what I want;

## Softmax-based Dice loss U-Net model
+ Implement --//--;

## Evaluation loop
- Improve current evaluation loop;

## JSW array calculation
- Find bug in the min-dist method of computing the JSW array;
    * The bug might be that the euclidean distance is applied on integers coming from the pixel indices;
- Try the radial projection method;
- Try other border identification methods (ones suggested by Gijs and Kees);
+ DTW-based JSW;

# 29th of May 2024 TODOs
+ Implement `ResizeWithPadOrCrop` DICOM transform;
    * Note: I only implemented `Pad` since `Crop` likely to give unwanted results;
+ Go do ACS Paper session;
    * 13:45 - 15:30, online;
- Read more on pixel intensity normalization methods (Min-Max, Z-Score, Percentiles etc.);
- Read mails from Gijs;
- Implement methods for computing the JSW array;

# Group meeting notes - 30th of May 2024
* Take care when using the Cross Entropy loss/metric:
    * it will pull the output values to the extremes,
        but after applying the sigmoid, the segmentation
        will be just as good as a Dice loss segmentation;
    * essentially, the CE trained model might seem better
        than the Dice one, but in reality it might not be;

* Threshold activation at 0.5 -> what is the best threshold?

* Predicted mask vs. real mask overlap:
    * bottom line of femur being hard to predict;
    * how to get around this problem?
        * early-stop?
        * threshold line below which we don't compute loss?

* How do we handle images with fully broken hip joint or ones with prosthesis?

* Loss/metric functions: Dice, CE, DiceCE, Hausdorff, IoU, Jaccard, Tversky, ...

# Q&A meeting notes - 4th of June 2024

* Ideally, they want a model trained on all data;
* Can also do smaller datasets and argue for how much data we need;

---------------------------------------------------------

# Group meeting notes - 6th of June 2024

* Explain the what's and why's about the U-Net in the Methodology section;
* Preprocessing phase description goes into Experiment(-al) Setup

---------------------------------------------------------

# Paper and Poster TODOs
- Add ***Methodology section***;
- Submit ACS assignment 4 (overdue!);
- ACS poster session;
    * Scheduled: Wednesday, 29th of May 2024;
- Submit ***Poster/Paper Draft V2***;
    * Deadline: Saturday, 8th of June 2024;

- Impact on patient and doctor;
