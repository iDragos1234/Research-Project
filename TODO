# Coding TODOs

## Dicom Preprocessor
+ Migrate `CropOrPad` transformation from `model.py` to `dicom_transformations.py`;
    + Add new command-line args for setting the desired image size after applying `CropOrPad`;
    * Note: I only implemented `Pad` since `Crop` likely to give unwanted results;
+ Improve transformations;

## Data splitter
- Train/valid/test data splitter;
- Output split to .csv file;

## DicomDataset
- Improve current dataset class;
- Improve dataset builder class;

## Training loop
- Improve current training loop;
- Save metrics, losses, images and masks;

## Softmax-based Dice loss U-Net model
- Implement 

## Evaluation loop
- Improve current evaluation loop;

## JSW array calculation
- Find bug in the min-dist method of computing the JSW array;
    * The bug might be that the euclidean distance is applied on integers coming from the pixel indices;
- Try the radial projection method;
- Try other border identification methods (ones suggested by Gijs and Kees);
+ DTW-based JSW;

---------------------------------------------------------

# Paper and Poster TODOs
- Add ***Methodology section***;
- Submit ACS assignment 4 (overdue!);
- ACS poster session;
    * Scheduled: Wednesday, 29th of May 2024;
- Submit ***Poster/Paper Draft V1***;
    * Deadline: Monday, 3rd of June 2024;

# 29th of May 2024 TODOs
+ Implement `ResizeWithPadOrCrop` DICOM transformation;
    * Note: I only implemented `Pad` since `Crop` likely to give unwanted results;
+ Go do ACS Paper session;
    * 13:45 - 15:30, online;
- Read more on pixel intensity normalization methods (Min-Max, Z-Score, Percentiles etc.);
- Read mails from Gijs;
- Implement methods for computing the JSW array;
